This app provides a collaborative listening room for skiiers.  Skiers can choose a room then search and queue up songs that synchronize with their playback with everyone on a particular room. Queued up songs will play in order as they are put into the queue. Skiers in the same room can chat with each other as well.



Repo Organization:
  The actual code to run the project is located under the liveChat file folder
  where there is a seperate folder for the views and and then a server.js file
  
Running the app:
  In order to run the website locally: type 'node server.js' in the liveChat directory
  then in the web browser type localhost:8888 which is the port the website runs on.
